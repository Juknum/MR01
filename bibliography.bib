	abstract = {Google Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for measuring the quality of web pages. It can be run against any web page, public or, requiring authentication. Google Lighthouse audits performance, accessibility, and search engine optimization factors of web pages, this is the major difference from Google PageSpeed, the Google Lighthouse provides more detail information. It also includes the ability to test progressive web applications for compliance with standards and best practices. Google Lighthouse is developed by Google and aims to help web developers, the tool can be run by using Chrome browser extension or by using terminal (command) for batch auditing a list of URLs. Google's recommendation is for using the online version of Page Speed Insights as of 15th May 2015.Google Lighthouse [Version 10 - May 2023] includes a metric for Progressive Web Applications to ensure that PWA's are fast and reliable, installable and optimised for modern 7th and 8th generation mobile technology. Google Lighthouse can audit webpage in desktop version and mobile version. In command mode (cmd in Windows), the developer is able to select the factors that need to be audited and other options by using the command line.
Recent versions of Google Lighthouse offer insights into how to optimize the Core Web Vitals metrics (which is one of the signals used by Google's algorithm to rank pages), as announced by Google engineer Addy Osmani in 2021. As of now, Google uses three parameters to measure Core Web Vitals compliance, which are:

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
Total Blocking Time (TBT) as a proxy for First Input Delay (FID)On 10th May 2023, Google announced that INP will replace FID as the metric measuring responsiveness of a page. The move is aimed at getting a better handle on the total time taken for user interactions, rather than just the first interaction. These changes will start affecting page results from March 2024.},

Despite this knowledge, user experience (UX) designers often prioritise beauty over intended end-user affect. This reversed order of prioritisation contradicts the sequential UX design process, leading to unexpected end-user perceptions and responses. The challenge in shaping UX before user interface (UI) design is that there first must be prior knowledge of aesthetic affect. A study with 1,782 worldwide participants was conducted evaluating affective user-responses to 43 atomic aesthetics using 153,252 data points and presented as affect ratings (ARs). Results demonstrated high affective resonance amongst aesthetics evaluated, suggesting aesthetic AR may be a viable method of improving the UX design process by influencing user perceptions, responses and actions at a non-conscious level. This is the first of a series of studies in the direction of Aesthetic Semantics®.},

It is essential to be aware of the software development approaches that can support the design of accessible applications. Their main goal is to ensure that the interactive applications are available to everyone, including people with disabilities, reduced skills, or momentarily induced impairments. This paper aims to identify the accessibility barriers that occur when using design patterns for building user interfaces of mobile apps and propose guidelines to prevent the problems most often encountered. We start by conducting a gray literature review in professional forums and blogs to reveal the difficulties developers face when using mobile user interface design patterns. We thus compiled a catalog which contains the descriptions of 9 user interface design patterns, the accessibility barriers linked to the use of each pattern and the guidelines that can be followed to prevent the problem of these barriers. We carried out an evaluation of the use of the catalog with 60 participants. Our results show that in most cases, the guidelines were correctly applied for the prototyping of mobile user interfaces. The findings also revealed the usefulness and ease-of-use of the guidelines from the perspective of the participants.},

We know that diabetes is a challenge that the world is experiencing, and we must also understand the high-level user goals and objectives. We must understand if success metrics are the same for each user, whether or not we can use the same approach to measure success, and how we can address each type of user with diabetes. To ensure that your product is successful, it is imperative that you have an intuitive interface and a user-friendly experience—especially for more complex solutions. Understanding the user deeply (their challenges, their expectations, their risks, and the industry barrier from past to present day) allows digital health products and solutions to be more interactive and engaging. The tone of this chapter is meant to take the reader through the exploration process of a UI/UX designer. You will learn high-level design thinking concepts by asking questions and building empathy for persons with diabetes, review the steps to improve UI/UX design for digital health for diabetes, and envision the future with better designed solutions for diabetes. Digital health has experienced a major shift during the pandemic. Technological advancements like improved usability and navigation can result in improved user experiences.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Clinical information systems (CISs) used in intensive care units (ICU) integrate large amounts of patient data every minute, and from multiple systems and devices. Intensive care requires efficient use of information technology to acquire, synchronize, integrate, and analyze data in order to make quick decisions and implement interventions in a timely manner.
Objectives
To identify factors affecting poor user experience (UX) of CISs used in ICUs in Finland.
Methods
Data from national Electronic Health Record (EHR) and user experience survey was undertaken in 2017. Those, who used the ICU CIS on a daily or weekly basis were asked supplementary questions and, therefore, comprise a subset of the responses reported in this article.
Results
On a 4–10 scale (i.e., “Fail” to “Excellent”), the mean ‘grade’ for the principally used ICU CIS was 6.9 (SD 1.3) points. Of the respondents, 119 (57\%) were categorized as having good UX. The factors identified as affecting poor UX of the ICU CISs related to poor interface design (OR 7.8; 95\% CIs 12.5–24.1; p = 0.001), insufficient customizability (OR 7.2; 95\% CIs 1.7–30.6; p = 0.008), the inefficiency of performing routine tasks (OR 4.3; 95\% CIs 1.0–18.2; p = 0.044), malfunctions (OR 3.5; 95\% CIs 1.2–9.6; p = 0.019), and difficulties in information retrieval (OR 3.0; 95\% CIs 1.0–8.8; p = 0.044). The most commonly reported usability problems with the main EHR system and ICU CISs were also identified.
Conclusions
Overall satisfaction with the principally used ICU CIS was moderate. However, the overall grades varied significantly. Poor interface design, insufficient customizability, inefficiency, malfunctions, and difficulties in information retrieval all affect poor UX.},

	abstract = {In a post-pandemic era marked by thriving digital payments and e-commerce transactions due to physical distancing norms, the growth of mobile payments or E-wallets is expected to expand in tandem with the global trend toward cashless payment solutions. However, it is unclear whether this momentum would be sustained for over-the-counter (OTC) retail payments, particularly QR-code E-wallets, that are more affordable and accessible to merchants and customers than NFC-based (near field communication) systems in emerging markets. This study aims to model the interaction effects of brand image in shaping consumers’ E-wallet usage intentions. Incorporating a consumer-brand relationship element (i.e., brand image) should improve the understanding of consumers’ digital service experiences in proximity-based retail encounters. The research model was empirically tested using 305 responses from QR-based E-wallet users in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Statistical analysis was performed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses. An empirical examination of the model revealed effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and perceived value as significant positive predictors of consumer usage intention. Furthermore, brand image was found to significantly strengthen the positive effect of perceived value and weaken the positive impact of hedonic motivation on the outcome. The study’s key contributions include reaffirming the crucial contingent role of brand image in consumer technology adoption studies and investigating consumer perceptions of QR-based E-wallets, which are expected to gain traction, especially in emerging markets. E-wallet providers should reinforce their value propositions by providing seamless, engaging, and easy-to-use experiences that improve users' brand perceptions.},

This special issue focuses on “Interplay between User Experience Evaluation and Software Development”, stating that the gap between human-computer interaction and software engineering with regard to usability has somewhat been narrowed. Unfortunately, our experience shows that software development organizations perform few usability engineering activities or none at all. Several authors acknowledge that, in order to understand the reasons of the limited impact of usability engineering and UX methods, and to try to modify this situation, it is fundamental to thoroughly analyze current software development practices, involving practitioners and possibly working from inside the companies. This article contributes to this research line by reporting an experimental study conducted with software companies. The study has confirmed that still too many companies either neglect usability and UX, or do not properly consider them. Interesting problems emerged. This article gives suggestions on how they may be properly addressed, since their solution is the starting point for reducing the gap between research and practice of usability and UX. It also provides further evidence on the value of the research method, called Cooperative Method Development, based on the collaboration of researchers and practitioners in carrying out empirical research; it has been used in a step of the performed study and has revealed to be instrumental for showing practitioners why to improve their development processes and how to do so.},

	abstract = {Accessibility revolves around building products, including electronic devices and digital content, so that diverse users can conveniently utilize them, irrespective of their capabilities. In recent years, the concept of touchscreen accessibility has gained a remarkable attention, especially within the considerable reliance on mobile touchscreen devices (MTDs) for information acquisition and dissemination as we witness nowadays. For users who are visually impaired, MTDs unlock different opportunities for independence and functioning. Thus, with the increasing ubiquity of MTDs and their potential extensive utility for all demographics, it becomes paramount to ensure that these devices and the content delivered on them are accessible. And while it might seem straightforward to achieve accessibility on MTDs, attaining this outcome is governed by an interplay between different elements. These involve platform (i.e., operating system) built-in support of accessibility features, content rendering modalities and structures pertaining to user needs and the peculiarities of MTDs as informed in standard accessibility guidelines, user studies uncovering preferences and best practices while interacting with MTDs, national legislations and policies, and the use of third-party devices such as assistive technologies. In this paper, mobile touchscreen accessibility for users who are visually impaired is surveyed with focus on three aspects: (1) the existing built-in accessibility features within popular mobile platforms; (2) the nature of non-visual interaction and how users who are visually impaired access, navigate, and create content on MTDs; and (3) the studies that tackled different issues pertaining to touchscreen accessibility, such as extraction of user needs and interaction preferences, identification of most critical accessibility problems encountered on MTDs, integrating mobile accessibility in standard accessibility guidelines, and investigation of existing guidelines in terms of sufficiency and appropriateness.},

The web is a source of public information, education, employment, government, commerce, health, entertainment, and many others, and every person, regardless of ability, has the right to access it. Imagine missing out on thousands of new customers because your competitor has an easier-to-use, WCAG-compliant website. This systematic literature review aims to analyze the empirical methods of evaluating accessibility to educational websites, disabilities, and errors. Some of the papers we will review here use automated tools, real users, or experts to evaluate web accessibility. After analyzing the results, we will determine if the websites comply or not with the Web Accessibility Content Guidelines (WCAG). Also, what are the differences between automated tools, real users, and experts in evaluating websites.},

Si ce chiffre est aussi élevé, c'est parce que ces dernières années, le numérique s'est immiscé dans tous les domaines : la dématérialisation des services administratifs, le complotisme, l'engagement citoyen, la consommation... L'inclusion repose sur l'accompagnement des exclus, mais aussi sur une réflexion concernant l'évolution de la société numérique et ses obstacles comme l'adaptabilité aux handicapés ou encore le développement des accès en fibre optique. L'auteur remet ici en cause plusieurs idées reçues : les personnes âgées ne sont pas les seules concernées par l'exclusion numérique, la couverture en fibre optique n'avance pas aussi bien que prévu, la dématérialisation des services publics ne simplifie pas toujours les démarches des usagers, ce qui ne favorise pas leur passage au numérique. Ce constat est au coeur de l'actualité. Beaucoup de médias en parlent, toutes les grandes associations sociales se mobilisent sur le sujet ainsi que les collectivités locales (mairies, départements) en zones rurales ou urbaines, mais aussi les grandes entreprises, à travers leurs politiques RSE. Malgré tout, trop de Français sont encore touchés par ce phénomène d'exclusion. C'est la première fois que le sujet est traité en profondeur en dehors des rapports du Sénat et de quelques ONG. L'auteur s'attache à rendre compte de la situation, énonce les solutions mises en place, et se questionne sur l'avenir."},

Therefore, we present a case study, where we tested three accessibility assessment tools against the official website of Portuguese Institute for Employment and Vocational (IEFP), used by millions of users nationwide. Indeed, we found that individual tools still provide limited coverage of success criteria and, thus, user verification is consistently needed. In this regard, we also aim at proposing a new tool called IncWeb, that can automatically alter any web or mobile application into a usable and fully accessible one, in a way that is transparent to the user and adapted to his type of disability. As such, this work emphasizes the importance of having appropriate tools to facilitate the lives of people with disabilities and/or special needs, presenting not only the problems of other assessment tools, but also proposing a new paradigm-changing solution to overcome those known challenges.},
